              Turning <em>product briefs</em> into shipped software: the service underneath, the

                I'm a software developer first, and a tinkerer second. Driven by a need to keep
                learning and improving, I stumbled into the world of development almost by
                accident while pursuing a degree in psychology, and landed my first fulltime tech job at a
                company specializing in authentication, identity, and payments a few years later.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.para}>
                Since then, I spend my days obsessing over the user experience, experimenting
                with design, and bridging what product needs with what the rest of the
                engineering team can build.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.para}>
                On my own time, I'm continually taking on client projects as they come in as well as personal ones to hone my skills. It's nice to at least
                have something to show that isn't behind an NDA 😅. Most of the projects below
                are exactly that.
